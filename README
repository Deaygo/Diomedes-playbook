Instructions for running the dev environment:

Running the dev environment requires the Adobe AIR SDK for Ajax:

  Download http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/entitlement/index.cfm?e=airsdk

Diomedes is built using JavaScript and the Dojo framework:

Documentation for Dojo:
http://www.dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/dojo/index.html#dojo-index

Also required is a bash environment, as currently the dev setup uses bash scripts.
Windows developers can probably use cygwin, but I haven't tested this.

Various different configurations are provided:

 * Diomedes-app.xml For production. Requires a release be built (instructions below).
    Air inspector is disabled.
 * Diomedes-app-dev.xml For development. No release required. Use this for general development.
    changes will be available immediately. Air inspector enabled
 * Diomedes-app-debug.xml For debugging. Requires a release. Uses the uncompressed version of the 
    release to make it easy to find errors when exceptions are thrown. AIR inspector enabled.

If you installed the Adobe AIR SDK in ~/air then run the dev setup as so:
~/air/bin/adl Diomedes-app-dev.xml

When you make changes restart the application.

Please ensure that any patches pass the jSlint tests. You can run those with 
./checkErrors from trunk. Also add your name and email to AUTHORS if it
isn't there already.

./createRelease will create a release for debugging.

./createScript will attempt to create a production release after running tests, but this will
fail unless you provide your own certificate and modify the script to point to this.
